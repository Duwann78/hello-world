# hello-world
Hello All
I'm completely new to this. I have always had a fascination with technology and programming. I must admit that I am bit nervous, I've always pushed the thought of a coding career away because I felt that I was not smart enough to understand. I have finally gained the confidence to at least give it a try and put my best effort in learning a new skill. I look forward to this new journey.
